# Connection-Pooling-in-MySQL

This is a continuation of the [My SQL Project](https://github.com/Data-Dr-hub/MySQL-Project) on an imaginary Little Lemon Restaurant.
This project goes a step further to demonstrate my skills in:
* [Connection Pooling](Connection%20Pooling%20&%20Stored%20Procedures.ipynb)
* [Detailed Analysis and Sales Report](Little%20Lemon%20Analysis%20&%20Sales%20Report.ipynb)
* Error Handling in Python.

Thanks for stopping by.
